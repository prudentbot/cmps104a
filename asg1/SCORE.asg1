Copy this file and all test files into the submit directory.
Run the script mk.build then mk.test.
After each item below, indicate with a negative number the
reason for each point deduction.

=================================================================

SOURCE CODE /30 points

    mk.build

    (3) checksource did not complain.  If it does, deduct
        minimum (3, int (complaints / 5))
        (But do not deduct for flex/bison generated code).

    (3) Good overall coding style, choice of identifiers,
        readability indentation.

    (3) Code run through cpp and output examined.

    (3) ?????????? (ignore this - requirement deleted)

    (3) hash table intern function only interns a string once

    (3) collision resolution method, either probing or chaining
        and array doubling code

    (3) uses getopt to analyze options

    (3) error messages to stderr, not stdout

    (3) programs compile without errors or warnings from gcc

    (3) Filenames and suffices as appropriate

min 3, max 30

=================================================================

PROGRAM TESTING /30 points

    mk.tests

    If an executable called oc was not built by make, skip this
    section and assign 0 points.

    (3) exit status 0 for successful compiles, non-zero for fail

    (3) collision resolution chains all short or clusters all amall

    (3) reports on any errors from cpp by exit status 1

    (3) reads all tokens from input files

    (3) nothing printed to stdout.

    (6) Deduct 2 points, max 6, for each run that reports a
        seg fault, dumps core, etc.

    (9) output files for foo.oc called foo.str with correctly
        formatted contents, deduct 2 points for each which is not,
        but not more than 9 points
	It is okay to create an empty .str file if string table is empty
